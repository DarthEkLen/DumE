Open Projects 2021


# ABSTRACT

Dum-E is a pick-up and place, robotic arm. Equipped with image processing and computer vision,it can 
detect and classify objects on the basis of their color or shape. Currently, it can operate in static
environments, that is where obstacles and the object are not moving.



# MOTIVATION

The name Dum-E, itself is a hint of our source if inspiration for doing this project. After all,who 
hasn't watched Iron Man. Dum-E first appeared in Iron Man I, though it keep messing things for Tony, 
it had saved his life too. 
Our inspiration was simply to make something cool and learn the basics of robotics, computer vision,
image processing and the various platforms which can be used for designing and simulating our robotic arm.

# APPLICATIONS

Dum-E is a perfect robotic arm for performing simple tasks in factory settings. It can also be used in household for any kind of pick up and place tasks.



# LIMITATIONS 

While we did our best, given the time duration of project, there is much space for going plus ultra. 
Presently Dum-E can't function in a dynamic environment. Dum-E also has only a modest reach, which restricts it to lift only small, light objects.



# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

In future, we would work on making Dum-E function in a dynamic environment. Also, we try to enable Dum-E as a whole and not just its end-effector to move in dynamic environment.
